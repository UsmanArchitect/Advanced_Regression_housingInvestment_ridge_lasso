## General Information
1. company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 
2. build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
3. The company wants to know:
•	Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
•	How well those variables describe the price of a house.


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
1. Models built using Ridge and Lasso Regression using k-fold grid search CV on training dataset.
2. Selected Lasso model as the number of dependent variables reduced to 53 as against to Ridge.
3. Both the models are showing similar results on both train and test dataset.
